# Travel Guide

Travel Guide is a web application with the goal of being a hub of information for popular tourist locations.

- Built using Vite and created with React for a component based project. Styling with TailwindCSS to complement React's components.
- Completely serverless using JSON files for containing data.
- Client-side routing with React-Router's data router.

## Key Features

- **CSS:** Animations, Font Delivery Services, Responsive Design, and Reactive Elements.
- **HTML:** Forms and Inputs, Iframes, and Semantic Tags.
- **React:** Providers, States, Refs, Memos, Contexts, Custom Hooks, and Conditional Rendering.

## Installation and Use

Travel Guide uses npm for package management.

1. Clone the github repo.
2. Use `npm install` to install all the necessary packages.
3. Run the dev build using the `npm run start` command.

*There is an issue with the "Countries" page. Due to how most modern browsers handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, the use of the iframe is unable to show the outside website without an external workaround.
